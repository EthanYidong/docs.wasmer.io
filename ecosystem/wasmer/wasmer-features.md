# Wasmer Features

Wasmer WebAssembly runtime provides multiple features for their users/developers:

* **Backends:** Wasmer supports multiple backends: _Singlepass_, _Cranelift_ and _LLVM_. Each of those with different tradeoffs for compilation and runtime speed.
* **Caching**: it allows to reuse the compiled WebAssembly code, so subsequent runs of a Wasm file will run as fast as possible
* **Metering**: it allows to track and limit the usage of functions within the host. This is also known as "gas metering"
* _WebAssembly Features_:
  * **Multi-value return**: it's a proposal that allows function to return more than one value at a time
  * **SIMD**: Single Instruction, Multiple data
* ABIs: it allows to run different programs compiled to WebAssembly, with ABIs such as:
  * **Emscripten**
  * **WASI**

### Language integration

TODO: define a set of features that are relevant and mark them here

Current ideas:

* Callbacks
* Metering
* Caching

> TODO: expand this table, it's focused on new features that we haven't implemented yet and doesn't list all language integrations
