# WAPM

[WAPM](https://wapm.io/) is a package manager for WebAssembly modules to be used standalone by any WebAssembly Runtime \(such as the Wasmer Runtime\):

* [wapm.io](https://cheerpxdemos.leaningtech.com/prehisto.html)
* [wapm-cli Github Repo](https://github.com/wasmerio/wapm-cli)

The WAPM ecosystem makes WebAssembly more accessible to developers. The system is enabled by a couple tools:

* wapm package registry for storing and serving packages
* wapm package client \(called _wapm-cli_\) for installing and managing packages

The tool comes bundled with [wasmer: the WebAssembly runtime](https://wasmer.io/), but it works great with the other [server-side runtimes](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm#non-web-embeddings) and the web!
