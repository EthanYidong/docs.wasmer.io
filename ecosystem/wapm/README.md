# WAPM

[WAPM](https://wapm.io/) is a Package Manager for WebAssembly modules to be used standalone by any WebAssembly Runtime \(such as the [Wasmer Runtime](../wasmer/)\):

* WAPM Package Registry for storing and serving packages

  [wapm.io](https://cheerpxdemos.leaningtech.com/prehisto.html)

* WAPM package client \(called `wapm` CLI\) for installing and managing packages [wapm-cli Github Repo](https://github.com/wasmerio/wapm-cli)

The `wapm` tool comes bundled with [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/), but it works great with the other [server-side runtimes](https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm#non-web-embeddings) and [the web](../webassembly.sh.md)!
