# Wasmer Features

The Wasmer WebAssembly runtime provides various features for users and developers:

* **Backends:** Wasmer supports multiple compiler backends: _Singlepass_, _Cranelift_ and _LLVM_. Each of these have different tradeoffs of compilation speed vs runtime speed.
* **Caching**: compiled WebAssembly modules can be reused so subsequent runs of a Wasm file will have very little start up time
* **Metering**: computation time and other resources can be monitored and limits set to control how the Wasm code runs. This is also known as "gas metering"
* _WebAssembly Features_:
  * **Multi-value return**: return multiple values from functions making data transfer between host and guest simpler
  * **SIMD**: Single Instruction, Multiple data: do heavy number crunching more quickly and/or with lower power usage
* ABIs: it allows to run different types of programs compiled to WebAssembly, with ABIs such as:
  * **Emscripten**
  * **WASI**

## Language integration

TODO: define a set of features that are relevant and mark them here

Current ideas:

* Callbacks
* Metering
* Caching

> TODO: expand this table, it's focused on new features that we haven't implemented yet and doesn't list all language integrations
